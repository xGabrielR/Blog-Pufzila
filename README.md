<h2>0. Bussiness Problem</h2>
<hr>
<p>First, I met the Pufzila on a Discord server of a game, is a Arts Teacher / Geral teacher and story writer (chronicles, medieval stories), but he doesn't have a website or a blog to show his work in a 'more professional way', he only send the history on Instagram and Discord.</p>
<p>Knowing this, how can I encourage you to develop better and more complete projects and chronicles?</p>

> *How will Pufzila be able to register their projects on a more interesting platform and share them with the world ?*

<h3>0.1. What is a Blog ?</h3>
<p>Blog is a simple site where the objective is to share stories, documentaries or any other type of subject divided into posts, each post has a date and a category. For example, a recipe site is a blog where each post is a recipe and throughout the week that same site is updated with new recipes.</p>

<h2>1. Solution Strategy</h2>
